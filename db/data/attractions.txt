Notre Dame Cathedral~48.853024~2.349711~FR~A8~75~751~75056~Europe/Paris~The city's cathedral ranks as one of the greatest achievements of Gothic architecture. Notre Dame (the Cathedral of Our Lady) was begun in 1163 and completed around 1350. It stands on the Ile de la Cité, the oldest part of Paris.

Bunratty Castle~52.6966667~-8.8155556~IE~03~~~~Europe/Dublin~The site on which Bunratty Castle stands was in origin a Viking Trading Camp in 970. The present structure is the last of four castles to be built on the site. Robert De Muscegros, a Norman, built the first defensive fortress (an earthen mound with a strong wooden tower on top) in 1250. His lands were later granted to Thomas De Clare who built the first stone castle on the site. About this time Bunratty became a large town of 1,000 inhabitants.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENIn 1318 Richard De Clare, son of Thomas was killed in a battle between the Irish and the Normans. His followers were routed and the castle and town were completely destroyed. The castle was restored for the King of England but was laid waste in 1332 by the Irish Chieftains of Thomond under the O'Briens and MacNamaras. It lay in ruins for 21 years until it was rebuilt by Sir Thomas Rokeby but was once again attacked by the Irish and the castle remained in Irish hands thereafter.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe powerful MacNamara family built the present structure around 1425 but by 1475 it had became the stronghold of the O'Briens, the largest clan in North Munster. They ruled the territory of North Munster and lived in great splendor. The castle was surrounded by beautiful gardens and it was reputed to have a herd of 3,000 deer.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENUnder Henry VIII's 'surrender and re-grant' scheme, the O'Brien's were granted the title 'Earls of Thomond' and they agreed to profess loyalty to the King of England. The reign of the O'Briens came to an end with the arrival of the Cromwellian troops and the castle and its grounds were surrendered. The O'Briens never returned to Bunratty but later they built a beautiful residence at Dromoland Castle, now a luxury 5 star hotel.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENBunratty Castle and its lands were granted to various Plantation families, the last of whom was the Studdart family. They left the castle in 1804 (allowing it to fall into disrepair), to reside in the more comfortable and modern Bunratty House, which is open to the public in the grounds of the Folk Park.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENBunratty was to return to its former splendor when Viscount Lord Gort purchased it in 1954. The extensive restoration work began in 1945 with the help of the Office of Public Works, the Irish Tourist Board and Shannon Development.

Knappogue Castle ~52.7950922827~-8.8375625609~IE~03~~~~Europe/Dublin~Knappogue Castle was built in 1467 by Sean MacNamara, and is a magnificent example of a medieval tower house. It has a long and varied history ~ from a battle field to a dwelling place.  In 1571 the Castle became the seat of the MacNamara Clan ~ Earls of West Clancullen.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENDonagh MacNamara was a leader of the 1641 rebellion and then Knappogue remained in MacNamara hands until 1659 when it was confiscated by Cromwells parliament and granted to a ‘Roundhead’, Arthur Smith.  However after the monarchy was restored in 1670 Knappogue was returned to its MacNamara owners. The MacNamara Clan sold the castle to the Scotts in 1800 and they carried out major restoration and extension work.  In 1855, it was acquired by Lord Dunboyne who continued the restoration work. CR_TOKENRestoration of Knappogue CastleCR_TOKENCR_TOKENIn the 1920's Knappogue passed into the hands of a local farmer and fell into disrepair. Luckily, it was purchased in 1966 by the Hon. Mark Edwin Andrews of Houston Texas. He and his wife (a prominent American architect), in collaboration with Shannon Development, carried out an extensive and sensitive restoration returning the Castle to its former 15th Century glory while encompassing and retaining later additions which are a testament to the continuous occupation of the Castle.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe Andrews were the last occupants of the Castle. Shannon Development purchased the Castle in 1996 with the intention of preserving this important building for future generations.~2005448021_f8fa6cfd7b_o.jpg~image/jpeg~481043~Knappogue Castle~flyinfootwork~http://flickr.com/photos/flyinfootwork/2005448021/~171
Knappogue Castle Walled Garden~52.797380103~-8.8361320517~IE~03~~~~Europe/Dublin~In the magical setting of Knappogue Castle, the walled garden is a romantic oasis to sit and muse or just escape the ‘madding crowd’. Dating from 1817, the beautiful 1.76 acre garden is now restored to its former splendour. The tall and imposing walls of the walled garden, have now been refurnished with climbing roses, grapevines and many clematis varieties.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe beautiful garden lies a short distance to the North West of the castle.  There is an imposing arched cart entrance carrying a keystone inscribed 1817, which would appear to date the garden.  The tall and imposing, recently recapped walls of the garden are approximately 4.26 M high. Completely built of stone with no inner brick lining, they are now adorned with climbing roses, grapevines and fig trees. The north west, north east and south east corners of the wall are gently rounded, to facilitate the growing of fruit, which was a common feature of walled gardens of the late 18th and 19th century .CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe Walled Garden today has been carefully restored in the Victorian style. This is evidenced by the rectangular plots and system of paths, typical of the Victorian appreciation of order and symmetry.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENOriginally this would have been a productive garden, providing fruit, vegetables and flowers for the house, typical of demesnes of this kind.  A large walled garden was an essential requirement for such an establishment, not alone to supply the residence with produce, but to enjoy also as pleasure groundsCR_TOKENCR_TOKENEarly maps indicate that the garden was surrounded by extensive open parkland, ornamental ponds and a large orchard which, unfortunately, have not survived the passage of time. The doorway on the west wall once led to an orchard and a doorway on the south wall led to the shrubbery and pleasure grounds.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe garden's centrepiece - Bacchus, the Greek God of Wine, reflects the former epicurean philosophy & lifestyle of the mediaeval castle. The garden’s main features include the pergola, the tranquil gazebo, the rockery with fernery, shrubberys and pathways lined with herbaceous borders. The garden supplies the Castle with fresh herbs for daily use in the preparation of the mediaeval banquet.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENMaps dated 1840 and 1920 show a small rectangular building at the South West Corner of the garden.  Remains of the brick fireplace with a stone flue are still visible to this very day. This provides evidence that it was a small ‘Bothy’ which would have provided shelter for the gardeners and their equipment.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENOn the North Wall of the garden, you will see the remains of plastering, which shows evidence of a lean-to glasshouse. It was placed on this wall, facing south to catch maximum sun. It is impossible to determine if it was heated or not as there are no traces of piping or a boiler. The glasshouse is not shown on the 1840 and may therefore be late Victorian.~2930015861_c5938c3aec_b.jpg~image/jpeg~636794~Knappogue Castle~Kieran_Donnelly~http://flickr.com/photos/26338491@N04/2930015861/~172

Sainte-Foy abbey-church~44.5993640752~2.3982578517~FR~B3~12~122~12076~Europe/Paris~The Sainte-Foy abbey-church in Conques was a popular stop for pilgrims on their way to Santiago de Compostela, in what is now Spain. Its construction was begun on the foundations of a smaller earlier basilica, directed by the abbot Odolric (1031-1065) and completed around the year 1120. It was built in Romanesque style, using a warm-colored local limestone infilled with a local gray schist. The daringly large dome that originally covered the crossing later collapsed and was replaced in the 15th century.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe main draw for medieval pilgrims at Conques were the remains of Sainte Foy, a martyred young woman from the 4th century. Her name has been assimilated into the general conception of 'Holy Faith.' In the late 9th century, a monk from Conques allegedly stole these relics from a nearby monastery in order to draw travellers (and wealth) to Conques. The church that was eventually built had a double purpose: to accommodate the flock of pilgrims and at the same time to allow a community of monks to gather for the divine office seven times a day. Thus, Sainte-Foy has been designed like a pilgrimage shrine but also as an abbey-church. To serve the inhabitants of the town, a separate parish church was erected, dedicated to Saint Thomas of Canterbury. This smaller church is no longer standing.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENIn the 19th century, the author and antiquary Prosper Mérimée, appointed the first Inspector of Historical Monuments, inspired thorough restorations.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe Sainte-Foy abbey-church was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1998, as part of the World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France. Its Romanesque architecture, albeit somewhat updated in places, is displayed in periodic self-guided tour opportunities, especially of the upper level, some of which occur at night with live music and appropriately-adjusted light levels. A particularly interesting aspect of the church is the set of carvings of the "curieux" (the curious ones) who are peeking over the edges of the tympanum arch.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe late Hannah Green, an accomplished writer, penned a non-fiction work about Conques and the church entitled, "Little Saint".~3038833971_51c810fbc2_b.jpg~image/jpeg~733790~Sainte-Foy de Conques~juanlla~http://flickr.com/photos/juanlla/3038833971/~255
Treasury museum~44.6~2.4~FR~B3~12~122~12076~Europe/Paris~The west gallery of the cloisters is home to the small treasury museum, which has an admission fee. The 9th-century statue of St. Foy, which contains her relics, is the star attraction and a remarkable sight indeed. It is the only surviving example of the statue-reliquary shrine that was common in the Middle Ages, and the oldest surviving statue in western Christianity.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe seated figure is rather masculine in appearance for a young female saint - in fact, the head seems to have been reused from a statue of a Roman emperor. The face has a mild, almost blank expression but the eyes are piercing. Relics of the saint's skull are enshrined in the back of the statue.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe statue-reliquary is made of wood completely covered in gold. She wears golden robes and a crown encrusted with jewels and cameos, some dating from Roman times.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENAlso in the treasury are over 20 golden art masterpieces, including a 9th-century chest donated by King Pepin and the golden letter "A" from Charlemagne. It is said that Charlemagne had 24 golden letters made for 24 monasteries throughout his kingdom, and he liked Conques so much that it received the "A."

In the center of the courtyard is a large serpentine (dark greenish stone) basin, which was rebuilt from original parts as part of a renovation of the cloisters. It is decorated with with small atlas figures and other faces.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe gallery on the west side of the courtyard contains some fascinating Romanesque capitals, which were commissioned by Abbot Bégon III (1087-1107). Subjects of the capitals include knights in battle, horn-blowers, and an Annunciation. An especially charming capital depicts the site's construction workers leaning out over an unfinished tower, holding the tools of their trade.~25443178_0f56c989b0_b.jpg~image/jpeg~219663~Cloister, Abbey of Conques~Nick in exsilio~http://flickr.com/photos/pelegrino/25443178/~257

The top of the tomb is broken in two and there is a small hollow in the tomb, caused by dripping water, which is called the braon shinsior. This is regarded as a mark of divine displeasure of the way Edmund treated his fellow Catholics. CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe Dominican Friary or St. Saviour's Priory to give its proper title was established in 1291 when Gilbert Fitzgerald of the White Knights invited the Dominicans to the monastery that he had a built. The Fitzgeralds were the main benefactors of the friary and Maurice Fitzgerald was the main patron of the friary when it was enlarged in 1320. It is situated across the river Lúbach from the former parish church in Kilmallock.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENn 1639 three chalices were made for the convent in Kilmallock and inscriptions on all three mention the Burgatt family. There is a plaque to the Burgatt family in the choir of the priory. One of the chalices was given by Callaghan O'Callaghan includes a prayer for Maurice, son of Edward Fitzgibbon, the White Knight who died in 1608.

Its an easy visit to do with a baby/toddler and the souvenir shop is very good with lots of unique stuff/books (not just about the Abbey).

Killary Harbour~53.6086641~-9.803953169~IE~00~~~~Europe/Dublin~Killary Harbour / An Caoláire Rua is Ireland's only "fjord". It is disputed that it was actually formed by glaciers. It forms a partial border between counties Galway and Mayo. It is 16 kilometres long and in the centre it is over 45 metres deep.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENOn its northern shore lies the mountain of Mweelrea, 817 metres high. Directly opposite, on the southern, Galway side and near the mouth of the fjord, lies the hamlet of Rossroe and the former An Óige youth hostel, now disused. This building was itself converted and extended for the purpose and was formerly a modest house which was used by Ludwig Wittgenstein, the famous philosopher, as a quiet place to write shortly after World War II. A plaque to this effect was unveiled by President Mary Robinson in 1993. Nearby lies the so-called Green Road, a rough road running along the side of the fjord back east towards Leenane at the head of the fjord. It stretches for approximately nine kilometres and was part of the famine relief program during the 19th century. Aquaculture is important locally with a salmon farm based at Rossroe while mussel rafts are a common sight more to the east.~2265264306_05ac5587de_o.jpg~image/jpeg~208994~Leenane~andrebius~http://flickr.com/photos/andrebius/2265264306/~378
Twelve Bens~53.5050615284~-9.798460005~IE~10~~~~Europe/Dublin~The Twelve Bens or Twelve Pins (Irish Na Beanna Beola) is a small mountain range of sharp-peaked quartzite ranges located north east of Roundstone Village in Connemara in the west of Ireland.
