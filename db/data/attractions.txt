It was founded in 1168 on the site of a palace donated by Donal Mor O'Brien King of Munster.CR_TOKENIn keeping with the City Motto translated as " An ancient City well versed in the art of War". Legend has it that in the past the doorway had a more military purpose. During the many sieges of Limerick the defenders of the City used the stones around the door to sharpen their swords. They say, the marks they made in the stonework can be seen there to this day. CR_TOKENWhile the Cathedral is a beautiful and historic building, it is still used today for its original purpose, as a place of worship and prayer. The historic setting only adds to the wonderful atmosphere as the the people of Limerick continue to worship God today in its ancient and hollowed confines.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENIf the stones of this Cathedral could only talk and tell us what has happened here over the centuries, what a story they would tell. It would include the exploits of Kings and Princes, feasts and famines, military victories and defeats and Civic triumphs and disasters.

Notre Dame Cathedral~48.853024~2.349711~FR~A8~75~751~75056~Europe/Paris~The city's cathedral ranks as one of the greatest achievements of Gothic architecture. Notre Dame (the Cathedral of Our Lady) was begun in 1163 and completed around 1350. It stands on the Ile de la Cité, the oldest part of Paris. Notre Dame is the nucleus around which the capital city developed. The outside is as spectacular as the interior. The Cathedral is built to hold up to 9000 worshipers, but it is always packed with visitors during the times between church services. It is best to arrive early and allow enough time to walk around outside and inside in a leisurely way. The interior is dominated by enormous rose windows and a 7800-pipe organ that was recently restored. From the base of the north tower, physically fit visitors can climb to the top of the west façade and look above the cathedral's gargoyles, and out over the city of Paris.

None of the royal family ever actually lived there.CR_TOKENThe remainder of the square is configured with 36 symmetrical houses each with a ground-floor arcade, steep slate roof, large dormer windows and vine covered walls. The first of the houses were built of brick, the rest were built rapidly and given timber frames and faced with plaster. The plaster was later painted to resemble brick. Duels, fought with strictly observed formality, were once staged in the elegant park in the middle which contains a statue of Louis XIII.

The Romans called it Mons Jovis and built a temple to Jupiter there. A Jewish cemetery on the hill probably inspired its name (Mount of the Jews). Until 1640 when the castle was built, there were few buildings due to the lack of water. This trend was reversed in preparation for the World's Fair of 1929 when a building boom occurred. Huge exhibition halls lined the avenue and the Font Mágica (Magic Fountain) sprang up in the center. The fountain is now illuminated in color. Another building surge took place prior to the 1992 Olympic Games. This has left Barcelona with world class sports facilities.

The King's House~50.8467485465~4.3525017498~BE~BRU~BRU~21~21004~Europe/Brussels~At the market place, opposite the Town Hall, stands another of the remarkable historical buildings of Brussels. The beautiful neo-Gothic building with its many decorative statues is the "Maison du roi" in French or "Broodhuis" in Dutch. It contains the City Museum.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe Dutch name "Broodhuis" (I.e. bread house) clearly shows the origins of this building. In the beginning of the 13th century a wooden building stood in this spot from which the bakers sold their bread. In 1405 a stone building replaced the original wooden bread hall. During the early 15th century the bakers turned to selling their products from house to house, and the ancient bread hall was used more and more for administrative purposes by the duke of Brabant. It became known then as "Maison du roi" (the King's House). During the reign of Emperor Charles V, the king's house was rebuilt in Gothic style from 1515 until 1536.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENAfter the French bombardment of 1695 the building was restored only as far as was necessary to keep it from collapsing. In the following centuries it was used for different purposes. In 1860 the mayor of Brussels, Jules Anspach convinced the city authorities to buy the old king's house which by then was in a sorry state. The entire building had to be rebuilt. The restoration was done in the then fashionable neo-Gothic style. On June the 2nd 1887 the king's house became the city Museum of Brussels. On exhibition are original statues from the Town Hall, as well as paintings, wall tapestries and artifacts which relate to the history of the city.~344736586_e2e2bdb4a1_b.jpg~image/jpeg~430029~The King's House~Hiddenson~http://flickr.com/photos/hiddenson/344736586/~46

The first mention of the statue came from documents dating back to about 1377, but the current version is a copy; the original was kidnapped by French soldiers in 1747. In restitution King Louis XV of France presented the statue with a gold-embroidered suit, the first of a collection of ceremonial costumes that now numbers over 500.~528430338_de1c2ea073_b.jpg~image/jpeg~480635~Manneken Pis~oranje~http://flickr.com/photos/ajreilly/528430338/~48

The Basilica was built to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Belgian independence. In 1905 king Leopold II laid the first stone. According to the plans of architect Langerock it was to become a gigantic neo-Gothic church. The initial plans were stopped at the beginning of World War I. By the time construction resumed, a new architect, named Van Nuffel, was asked to construct a modern house of prayer. He changed the style from neo-Gothic to art deco. The result seems discordant to many. Construction of the church depended entirely on donations made by believers and these donations did not always yield the expected funds. The church was eventually finished in the late 1960's with the construction of a dome and dedicated to the War Victories of 1918 and 1944. ~1320088653_4aa32b695a_b.jpg~image/jpeg~475157~Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Brussels. ~Alex Jilitsky~http://flickr.com/photos/delpiero/1320088653/~49

This church can be found at the Treurenberg hill on the edge between lower and upper town. Already at the beginning of the 11th century a church was situated here. In 1047 the duke of Brabant, Lambert II, had the relics of Saint Gudula transferred from the Saint Gorik church in downtown Brussels to the new church at Treurenberg hill. From that moment on the Saint Gudula and Saint Michael church took the lead over all the other churches in Brussels. Lambert II also gave the church a chapter of 12 canons (= priests who took care of the services and possessions of the church). ~1432628217_624dc435c6_o.jpg~image/jpeg~278891~Thinking at the Cathedral~paco_calvino~http://flickr.com/photos/paco_calvino/1432628217/~50

Kampa Island~50.0864583~14.4084975~CZ~52~~~~Europe/Prague~Banks of Kampa Island are washed by water of Vltava river on the one side and on the other one by the Devil’s Stream, which separates it from the Lesser Town. Devil’s Stream was created in the 12th century as a millrace. This thus makes Kampa an artificial island. Its beauty is as real as it can be, though.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe use of the Devil’s Stream as a millrace suggests that first buildings appearing in the area were mills. At present there are three of them and two have still their mill-wheels. The most famous one is the Grand Prior’s Mill with its totally restored wheel measuring impressive eight metres. It is the one painted on all the romantic pictures you admire in art galleries. In the case you want to compare the paintings with the reality, you can take the artists’ view from the Charles Bridge.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe Devil's Stream You might also hear someone referring to this area as “the Venice of Prague”. Well, you would seek gondolas in vain but the atmosphere is just as lovely.CR_TOKENKampa then and nowCR_TOKENCR_TOKENHad you lived in the medieval times, you would have found only gardens on the entire island. A park designed in the English style can be found at the southern end of Kampa still nowadays whereas the northern part has Renaissance houses and a Baroque palace.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe very first buildings to appear here were the homes of bricklayers, carpenters and stonemasons so that they could comfortably keep an eye on Charles Bridge and maintain it in a perfect state. The square surrounded by these houses is the place where pottery used to be sold regularly. Kampa was namely also a place, where traditional pottery markets took place for centuries. CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe best way is to enjoy a walk over Charles Bridge in the direction to the Lesser Town and then walk down the stairs to Kampa. In the case you would like to come from the south, the best way is to take a tram to Ujezd (6, 9, 22 or 23) and walk down Ricni Street that will take you to the Devil’s Stream. ~2852560547_f3e700fb04_o.jpg~image/jpeg~58779~Kampa - Praha~Giuliagas~http://flickr.com/photos/giuliag/2852560547/in/set-72157607523300037/~129

Charles IV's favourite architect and builder, Peter Parler, oversaw the majority of the work. The initial idea was to build a functional construction for knight tournaments, and for many years the only decoration on the bridge was a simple crucifix. Later, the Catholic desire for ornamentation resulted in 30 statues being erected between 1600 and 1800.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThere are now 75 statues on Charles Bridge, but most are copies, as floods and catastrophes over the centuries damaged the originals. Perhaps the most interesting, as well as the oldest, is that of John of Nepomuk (8th from the right as you cross towards Prague Castle).CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe entrance to Charles Bridge is marked at both ends by towers: the Old Town Bridge Tower and the Mala Strana Bridge Tower.~412371599_79e1c00065_b.jpg~image/jpeg~579815~Charles Bridge~ronlayters~http://flickr.com/photos/ronlayters/412371599/~132

The pit was originally covered by the floor of the arena.  In it were kept the prisoners and the wild animals with whom they would compete. CR_TOKENThe arena was built by Emperor Vespasian in the year 72, on the site of a drained lake in the grounds of Nero’s Golden  palace.

The plan of the building was based by Bramante on the design of the ancient Roman baths which were laid out in the form of a Greek cross.  Bramante died in 1514, and it was not until 1547 that Michelangelo took over the project.  He simplified Bramante’s plan and increased the scale.  He introduced giant Corinthian pilasters around the exterior. When Michelangelo died in 1564 much of the apse, the transepts and nave had been completed.  His student, Giacomo della Porta, erected the dome in 1590 following Michelangelo’s design. The dome soars over the tomb of St. Peter. Beneath the dome and forming the focus of the nave is Bernini’s Baldacchino whose columns were cast from bronze stripped from the roof of the Pantheon.    CR_TOKENCR_TOKENMichelangelo’s Pieta stands in the first chapel to the right of the entrance.

Bunratty Castle~52.6966667~-8.8155556~IE~03~~~~Europe/Dublin~The site on which Bunratty Castle stands was in origin a Viking Trading Camp in 970. The present structure is the last of four castles to be built on the site. Robert De Muscegros, a Norman, built the first defensive fortress (an earthen mound with a strong wooden tower on top) in 1250. His lands were later granted to Thomas De Clare who built the first stone castle on the site. About this time Bunratty became a large town of 1,000 inhabitants.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENIn 1318 Richard De Clare, son of Thomas was killed in a battle between the Irish and the Normans. His followers were routed and the castle and town were completely destroyed. The castle was restored for the King of England but was laid waste in 1332 by the Irish Chieftains of Thomond under the O'Briens and MacNamaras. It lay in ruins for 21 years until it was rebuilt by Sir Thomas Rokeby but was once again attacked by the Irish and the castle remained in Irish hands thereafter.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe powerful MacNamara family built the present structure around 1425 but by 1475 it had became the stronghold of the O'Briens, the largest clan in North Munster. They ruled the territory of North Munster and lived in great splendor. The castle was surrounded by beautiful gardens and it was reputed to have a herd of 3,000 deer.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENUnder Henry VIII's 'surrender and re-grant' scheme, the O'Brien's were granted the title 'Earls of Thomond' and they agreed to profess loyalty to the King of England. The reign of the O'Briens came to an end with the arrival of the Cromwellian troops and the castle and its grounds were surrendered. The O'Briens never returned to Bunratty but later they built a beautiful residence at Dromoland Castle, now a luxury 5 star hotel.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENBunratty Castle and its lands were granted to various Plantation families, the last of whom was the Studdart family. They left the castle in 1804 (allowing it to fall into disrepair), to reside in the more comfortable and modern Bunratty House, which is open to the public in the grounds of the Folk Park.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENBunratty was to return to its former splendor when Viscount Lord Gort purchased it in 1954. The extensive restoration work began in 1945 with the help of the Office of Public Works, the Irish Tourist Board and Shannon Development.

In 1571 the Castle became the seat of the MacNamara Clan ~ Earls of West Clancullen.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENDonagh MacNamara was a leader of the 1641 rebellion and then Knappogue remained in MacNamara hands until 1659 when it was confiscated by Cromwells parliament and granted to a ‘Roundhead’, Arthur Smith.  However after the monarchy was restored in 1670 Knappogue was returned to its MacNamara owners. The MacNamara Clan sold the castle to the Scotts in 1800 and they carried out major restoration and extension work.  In 1855, it was acquired by Lord Dunboyne who continued the restoration work. CR_TOKENRestoration of Knappogue CastleCR_TOKENCR_TOKENIn the 1920's Knappogue passed into the hands of a local farmer and fell into disrepair. Luckily, it was purchased in 1966 by the Hon. Mark Edwin Andrews of Houston Texas.

Knappogue Castle Walled Garden~52.797380103~-8.8361320517~IE~03~~~~Europe/Dublin~In the magical setting of Knappogue Castle, the walled garden is a romantic oasis to sit and muse or just escape the ‘madding crowd’. Dating from 1817, the beautiful 1.76 acre garden is now restored to its former splendour. The tall and imposing walls of the walled garden, have now been refurnished with climbing roses, grapevines and many clematis varieties.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe beautiful garden lies a short distance to the North West of the castle.  There is an imposing arched cart entrance carrying a keystone inscribed 1817, which would appear to date the garden.  The tall and imposing, recently recapped walls of the garden are approximately 4.26 M high. Completely built of stone with no inner brick lining, they are now adorned with climbing roses, grapevines and fig trees. The north west, north east and south east corners of the wall are gently rounded, to facilitate the growing of fruit, which was a common feature of walled gardens of the late 18th and 19th century .CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe Walled Garden today has been carefully restored in the Victorian style. This is evidenced by the rectangular plots and system of paths, typical of the Victorian appreciation of order and symmetry.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENOriginally this would have been a productive garden, providing fruit, vegetables and flowers for the house, typical of demesnes of this kind.  A large walled garden was an essential requirement for such an establishment, not alone to supply the residence with produce, but to enjoy also as pleasure groundsCR_TOKENCR_TOKENEarly maps indicate that the garden was surrounded by extensive open parkland, ornamental ponds and a large orchard which, unfortunately, have not survived the passage of time. The doorway on the west wall once led to an orchard and a doorway on the south wall led to the shrubbery and pleasure grounds.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe garden's centrepiece - Bacchus, the Greek God of Wine, reflects the former epicurean philosophy & lifestyle of the mediaeval castle. The garden’s main features include the pergola, the tranquil gazebo, the rockery with fernery, shrubberys and pathways lined with herbaceous borders. The garden supplies the Castle with fresh herbs for daily use in the preparation of the mediaeval banquet.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENMaps dated 1840 and 1920 show a small rectangular building at the South West Corner of the garden.  Remains of the brick fireplace with a stone flue are still visible to this very day. This provides evidence that it was a small ‘Bothy’ which would have provided shelter for the gardeners and their equipment.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENOn the North Wall of the garden, you will see the remains of plastering, which shows evidence of a lean-to glasshouse. It was placed on this wall, facing south to catch maximum sun. It is impossible to determine if it was heated or not as there are no traces of piping or a boiler. The glasshouse is not shown on the 1840 and may therefore be late Victorian.~2930015861_c5938c3aec_b.jpg~image/jpeg~636794~Knappogue Castle~Kieran_Donnelly~http://flickr.com/photos/26338491@N04/2930015861/~172

Sainte-Foy abbey-church~44.5993640752~2.3982578517~FR~B3~12~122~12076~Europe/Paris~The Sainte-Foy abbey-church in Conques was a popular stop for pilgrims on their way to Santiago de Compostela, in what is now Spain. Its construction was begun on the foundations of a smaller earlier basilica, directed by the abbot Odolric (1031-1065) and completed around the year 1120. It was built in Romanesque style, using a warm-colored local limestone infilled with a local gray schist. The daringly large dome that originally covered the crossing later collapsed and was replaced in the 15th century.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe main draw for medieval pilgrims at Conques were the remains of Sainte Foy, a martyred young woman from the 4th century. Her name has been assimilated into the general conception of 'Holy Faith.' In the late 9th century, a monk from Conques allegedly stole these relics from a nearby monastery in order to draw travellers (and wealth) to Conques. The church that was eventually built had a double purpose: to accommodate the flock of pilgrims and at the same time to allow a community of monks to gather for the divine office seven times a day. Thus, Sainte-Foy has been designed like a pilgrimage shrine but also as an abbey-church. To serve the inhabitants of the town, a separate parish church was erected, dedicated to Saint Thomas of Canterbury. This smaller church is no longer standing.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENIn the 19th century, the author and antiquary Prosper Mérimée, appointed the first Inspector of Historical Monuments, inspired thorough restorations.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe Sainte-Foy abbey-church was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1998, as part of the World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France. Its Romanesque architecture, albeit somewhat updated in places, is displayed in periodic self-guided tour opportunities, especially of the upper level, some of which occur at night with live music and appropriately-adjusted light levels. A particularly interesting aspect of the church is the set of carvings of the "curieux" (the curious ones) who are peeking over the edges of the tympanum arch.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe late Hannah Green, an accomplished writer, penned a non-fiction work about Conques and the church entitled, "Little Saint".~3038833971_51c810fbc2_b.jpg~image/jpeg~733790~Sainte-Foy de Conques~juanlla~http://flickr.com/photos/juanlla/3038833971/~255

The 9th-century statue of St. Foy, which contains her relics, is the star attraction and a remarkable sight indeed. It is the only surviving example of the statue-reliquary shrine that was common in the Middle Ages, and the oldest surviving statue in western Christianity.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe seated figure is rather masculine in appearance for a young female saint - in fact, the head seems to have been reused from a statue of a Roman emperor. The face has a mild, almost blank expression but the eyes are piercing. Relics of the saint's skull are enshrined in the back of the statue.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENThe statue-reliquary is made of wood completely covered in gold. She wears golden robes and a crown encrusted with jewels and cameos, some dating from Roman times.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENAlso in the treasury are over 20 golden art masterpieces, including a 9th-century chest donated by King Pepin and the golden letter "A" from Charlemagne. It is said that Charlemagne had 24 golden letters made for 24 monasteries throughout his kingdom, and he liked Conques so much that it received the "A."

Architecturally, The Egg is without precedent. From a distance it seems as much a sculpture as a building. Though it appears to sit on the main platform, the stem that holds The Egg actually goes down through six stories deep into the Earth. The Egg keeps its shape by wearing a girdle - a heavily reinforced concrete beam that was poured along with the rest of the shell. This beam helps transmit The Egg's weight onto the supporting pedestal and gives the structure an ageless durability that belies its nickname.~207568530_b56275b3c8_b.jpg~image/jpeg~252252~Egg~fake is the new real~http://flickr.com/photos/fakeisthenewreal/207568530/~308

Ahead rises the great Doric temple of the Parthenon; built using no perpendicular lines. Its columns actually taper, giving the whole structure a feeling of superb lightness.

Pushkin Museum~55.747222~37.605~RU~48~~~~Europe/Moscow~he Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts (Russian: Музей изобразительных искусств им. А.С. Пушкина) is the largest museum of European art in Moscow, located in Volkhonka street, just opposite the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.CR_TOKENThe museum's name is misleading, as it has nothing to do with the famous Russian poet. It would be more fitting if the museum were named for its real founder, professor Ivan Tsvetaev (father of the poet Marina Tsvetaeva). Tsvetaev persuaded the young millionaire Yuriy Nechaev-Maltsov and the fashionable architect Roman Klein of the urgent need to give Moscow a fine arts museum.CR_TOKENDesigned by Klein and Shukhov, financed by Maltsov, the museum building was constructed from 1898 to 1912. Tsvetaev's dream was realised in May 1912, when the museum opened its doors to the public. The museum was originally named after Alexander III, although the government provided only 200,000 rubles toward its construction, in comparison with over 2 million from Nechaev-Maltsev. Its first exhibits were copies of ancient statuary, thought indispensable for the education of art students. The only genuinely ancient items - Moscow Mathematical Papyrus and Story of Wenamun - had been contributed by Vladimir Golenishchev three years earlier.CR_TOKENCR_TOKENCR_TOKENIvan Vladimirovich Tsvetaev (1847-1913)CR_TOKENAfter the Russian capital was moved to Moscow in 1918, the Soviet government decided to transfer thousands of works from St Petersburg's Hermitage Museum to the new capital. These paintings formed a nucleus of the Pushkin museum's collections of Western art. But the most important paintings were added later from the State Museum of New Western Art. These comprised Impressionist and Post-Impressionist artwork, including top works by Van Gogh, Gauguin, Picasso, and Matisse. In 1937, Pushkin's name was appended to the museum, because the Soviet Union marked the centenary of the poet's death that year.CR_TOKENAfter the World War II the evacuated Dresden Gallery had been stored in Moscow for 10 years. The Dresden collection was finally returned to East Germany, despite strong opposition from the museum officials, notably Irina Antonova, who has been running the museum since February 1961. The Pushkin Museum is still a main depositary of Troy's fabulous gold unearthed by Heinrich Schliemann and taken by the Soviet Army (Red Army) from the Pergamon Museum in Berlin.[1]CR_TOKENThe International musical festival Svyatoslav Richter's December nights has been held in the Pushkin museum since 1981.~Gmii.jpg~image/jpeg~73293~Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts~ walks.ru~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gmii.jpg~384
