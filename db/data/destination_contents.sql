With a determination to move ever forward in a direction of peace and harmony, this modern, bustling city greets visitors warmly. ','For two decades, news of Belfast was news about \"the Troubles\" until the 1994 cease-fire. Since then, this capital city with a population of 300,000 has turned around completely. It has benefited from major hotel and business investment, harborfront gentrification, the opening of a world renowned performing arts center, and a rediscovery of the many beautiful parks and quiet river walks that make Belfast a perfect place to visit.\n\nBelfast is easy to explore on foot. It takes about an hour to walk from one end of town to the other.\n\nThe heart of downtown Belfast sits beside the west bank of the River Lagan, centered upon Donegall Square, which holds the magnificent city hall. All roads radiate out from there. Donegall Place, which extends north from the square, leads to Royal Avenue, a prime shopping district. Bedford Street, extends south from the square, and becomes Dublin Road, which, in turn, leads to the quietly dignified Queen\'s University. Near the University are the Botanic Gardens, fine 19th-century buildings, and many excellent pubs and restaurants.\n\nNorth of this area, between Shaftesbury Square and Howard Street, is the Golden Mile, with hotels, major civic and office buildings, and some restaurants, cafés, and stores. City Hall marks the northern boundary of the Golden Mile and the southern end of the pedestrian-only central district, which extends from Donegall Square north almost to St. Anne\'s Cathedral. This is the center of old Belfast, and still a bustling place where both locals and visitors shop, chat in cafés, and go pubbing. Behind St. Anne\'s is the Cathedral Quarter, a maze of cobbled streets that resembles a combination of Temple Bar in Dublin and the Left Bank in Paris.\n\nThe city\'s architecture is rich in Victorian and Edwardian buildings with elaborate sculptures over the doors and windows. Some of Belfast\'s grandest buildings are on the banks of Waring Street. The Ulster Bank, dating from 1860, has an interior like a Venetian palace, and the Northern Bank, dating from 1769, was originally a market house.\n\nWith its large port, Belfast gained its reputation originally as an industrial city,. Major industries once flourishing there ranged from linen production to rope making and shipbuilding. The Titanic was built in Belfast port, and today the world\'s largest dry dock is there.','Belfast\'s main theatre spaces include the magnificent late-Victorian Grand Opera House, which is complemented by the new 2,000-seat Waterfront Hall. The Hall, which opened in 1997, has shown itself capable of hosting a variety of international shows from theatre to large-scale opera. Belfast is home also to the only repertory company in the region\n\nThe newest creative industry in Northern Ireland over the last ten years has been film. In partnership with the Northern Ireland Film Commission and with the co-operation of the BBC and Ulster Television, the Arts Council\'s Lottery Fund has been able to inject vital new financial backing into a burgeoning sector of the arts.\n\nNightlife is lively with the accompaniment of traditional Irish music as well as folk music, jazz and blues. Sports fans can enjoy rugby , hurling, tennis and football matches.

For areas outside it, there is an excellent subway system.</p>','<p>Over the centuries, Brussels (Bruxelles in French; Brussel in Flemish) has been ruled by every major power at or near its boundaries from the Romans to the Spanish to the Germans. Its colonial history provided a fitting prelude to its current status.

Residents of Brussels tend to be politically and religiously conservative and to cling to family and national traditions. The vast majority of Belgians are Roman Catholics, and despite a decline in church attendance, religious customs still flavor much of Belgium’s daily life.</p>','<p>“One of the most beautiful town squares in Europe, if not in the world”, is a phrase often heard when visitors in Brussels try to describe the beauty of this central market square. French speakers refer to it as the ‘Grand-Place’, and in Dutch it is called ‘de Grote Markt’.

The buildings of this vibrant capital city , from the historic houses of the Royal Mile to the elegant Georgian terraces and crescents of the New Town, offer the perfect complement to the natural setting. The city\'s layout is linear, in a pattern set by Castle Rock and Castle Ridge, down which the Royal Mile descends to the palace of Holyroodhouse. North of this lies a shallow valley holding the lovely Princes Street Gardens, with Waverley Station, the city\'s main railroad station at the eastern end. Above the gardens, and to the north is Edinburgh\'s main street, Princes Street. This is an ideal vantage point from which to view the castle and Old Edinburgh.\n\nEdinburgh\'s famous castle is especially beautiful. Upon entering the city, it commands immediate attention. The eye of the visitor is drawn to the impressive structure rising high above everything else on its sheer granite cliffs. There are incredible panoramic views from the upper stories of the castle, including a clear view of the distant sea. The castle sits high on the huge rock formation that juts out as if in defiance of any who would seek to invade Edinburgh. Castle Rock, as it is known, is inaccessible on three sides, and has a long, descending ridge on the fourth side.\n\nStudded with volcanic hills, Edinburgh has an incomparable location on the southern edge of the enormous Firth (River) of Forth. From the west end, beyond craggy Arthur\'s Seat and over the waters of the Firth of Forth, can be seen the Old and New Towns. Most of the city\'s sights are contained within these two districts: The Old Town is crowded with multistoried tenements dating from the 15th century and has ancient winding streets dotted with closes (entrances) and wynds (alleyways) on either side. The New Town, on the other hand, presents an orderly arrangement of Georgian buildings and a symmetrical grid of streets.\n\nThe effect of sightseeing in these two areas is that of stepping back in time, while still being in the present. At the same moment, you are in a totally intact medieval city, with all the original buildings, yet the people around you are from the modern day, and stores as we know them are functioning within the ancient structures. The contrast is incredible.','Edinburgh is a fine destination for a family vacation. Small children will delight in just running up and down the Royal Mile. A ride on the double decker bus is also a treat. Older children will rise to the challenge of climbing the steps to Arthur\'s Seat, and exploring what remains of the castle. The important things to keep in mind are to vary the activities of the day and to move at a leisurely pace. As long as children have ample opportunities to exercise and play, and have meals at regular intervals, they can tolerate and even enjoy many of the museums and exhibits that are of interest to adults. Plan the day and then cross off about half of that ambitious schedule, and add time to \"run in the park\" or \"watch the geese on the pond\", and you have the basic ingredients for a day of smiles and good humor. \n\nMany visitors entering into the ongoing debate over which is the best tasting malt whisky served in Edinburgh. The contenders are many: Highland malts, Lowland malts, Campeltown malts, Islay malts, to name a few. Many other nations have tried to replicate Scotch whisky, but none has succeeded. There is no way to authentically reproduce the Scottish combination of damp climate and soft water flowing through the peat at just the right temperature to produce the malt that forms the basis of the beverage.

Its ambience is passionate and intense. In fact, Naples retains a reputation as the most vibrant city in Italy.  ','Naples stretches out along the scenic Bay of Naples from Piazza Garibaldi in the east to Mergellina in the west.  At its back is lofty Vomero Hill. From Stazione Centrale, on Piazza Garibaldi, Corso Umberto I (known as the \"Rettifilo\"), a walking tour would  head southwest to the monumental city center,  around the piazzas Bovio, Municipio, and Trieste e Trento to the Palazzo Reale, Teatro San Carlo, and Galleria Umberto Primo. Central Naples is best explored on foot, as traffic jams of all sorts are commonplace.  It is wise to take a bus or cable car (funicular) to a general area and then proceed on foot. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo the north are the historic districts of old Naples, to the south lies the port. Farther west along the bay are the fashionable neighborhoods of Santa Lucia and Chiaia, and finally the waterfront district of Mergellina. The residential area of Vomero sits on the steep hills rising above Chiaia and downtown. At the center is the picturesque quarter of Spaccanapoli, the heart of the historic center. \r\n\r\nThe area surrounding Naples has a Greco-Roman history.   The Greeks set out to Hellenize Italy\'s southern regions in the 6th and 7th centuries BCE by settling at Cumae. Later, the Romans inhabited the area.  Both groups left ruins of archeological significance. The area west of Naples is known as the Campi Flegrei: literally, the fields of fire. These were described by the ancient Greeks as the entrance to Hades and were immortalized in literature as the “Elysian Fields”, a paradise for the deserving dead. Italy\'s two major seismic faults intersect at that point, and the whole area floats freely on a mass of molten lava very close to the surface.\r\n\r\n ','From Naples, visitors can travel down the coast to Pompei and the Sorrento Peninsula, both of which can be reached by train.  A boat trip to Sorrento gives the opportunity for a spectacular view of Naples from the sea.  Other side trips that should not be missed are to the slopes of Vesuvius where once flourished  the upscale, first century city of Pompeii;  the archeological site at Herculaneum, and the lovely islands of Capri and Ischia.   These tiny islands with their scenic beauty, picturesque villages,  and crystal clear waters welcome more than two million visitors annually.\r\n\r\nNeapolitan cuisine is famous worldwide, and ranks among the best in Italy.  There is a strong emphasis on the freshest fish and seafood and local fruits and vegetables form the fertile volcanic soil of the region. Local wines of note are Lacryma Christi and Greco di Tufo.  Limoncello is a delicately flavored lemon liqueur that is made all along the neighboring coast. \r\n\r\nDining in a Neapolitan restaurant is traditionally a festive occasion accompanied  by a wide  variety of savory pasta and thin crusted, tasty pizza dishes baked in wood-fired ovens. Although pizza, pasta, and seafood dishes are the symbols of Neapolitan cuisine, Naples is also known for its fine cheeses (including  mozzarella), and its delicious ice cream and superb pastries. Numerous salamis and excellent locally produced prosciutto round out the wide array of culinary possibilities.\r\n\r\nThe finest shopping area lies around Piazza dei Martiri and along Via dei Mille, Via Calabritto, Via Toledo, and Via Chiaia. Along these streets can be found outlets fo Italy’s top designers, as well as local stores selling fine leather goods.  There is  more commercial shopping between Piazza Trieste e Trento and Piazza Dante.  Jewelers abound near Via San Biagio as do the crafters of traditional nativity figurines.','2009-01-16 16:27:06','2009-01-16 16:27:06','<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/X2QKN9bmTCM&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/X2QKN9bmTCM&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>'),(78,292223,'<p>Dubai has something for everyone, from vacationers seeking a relaxing break away from the pressures of work, to active tourists looking for a new, exciting experience.

','When planning a trip to Athens, the weather is a consideration. Attica\'s sunshine and pleasant climate give visitors the opportunity to enjoy a trip to this beautiful city during any season. From March through May, it is almost always pleasant and mild. Between June and August, the temperature rises steadily, making August the month in which Athenians try to avoid the city. September is usually balmy, with occasional light rain. October offers beautiful weather. Most rain falls between November and February. Even so, there are many sunny days in winter and a brief, heavy rain is often followed by hours of brilliant sunshine. Average daytime temperatures range from 52F in January to 92F in August.\r\n\r\nAthens has a population of five million. It is the country\'s heart and the economic and industrial center, as well as the political and cultural center. No matter how crowded it becomes with residents and tourists, visitors still find it hospitable and welcoming.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the land is characterized by a constant alternation of low mountains and small plains. Bays and rocky or sandy coves dot the coast of Attica. During the summer the beaches are filled with Athenians and others enjoying their beauty.\r\n\r\nAthens can seem overwhelming at first. The mountains, the rocks, the historic ruins, the panoramic views of valleys and sea: nothing is small. Athens is not scrubbed and polished; it has an ancient, lived-in look as befits a city that has been inhabited for over 7000 years. Yet, it is so modern. An interesting feature of Athens is that it is a study in contradictions! At one moment you will be walking on modern streets with malls and superstores, then you will turn onto a side street and suddenly find yourself in another world with open air meat and fish markets, vegetable and fruit stands, and pigs, rabbits, and cows hanging upside down by their feet. \r\n\r\nThere are ruins in unexpected places throughout the city. What first appears to be a modern street will have fenced off areas containing parts of ancient toppled columns, statues, etc. They have been sitting there for hundreds of years and are now fenced for protection. Repair and restoration work is ongoing. A visit to the Acropolis will include the sight of workmen and ladders everywhere. The extensive work of preservation is impressive. ','Following a visit to the Acropolis, it is an easy downhill stroll to the Agora, the heart of ancient Athens\'s political and commercial center. The Agora is steps from the Monastiraki and Pláka districts, each filled with shops, cafes, and restaurants. The next stop might be the National Archaeological Museum to see the Mycenaean gold, the classical bronze statues, and the beautiful frescoes from Akrotiri, the Minoan Pompeii on the island of Santorini. It is hard to leave the Museum, so try to plan for a return visit on another day.\r\n\r\nThe whole family will enjoy a walk (run) through the National Gardens, and will be able to join Greek children in admiring the ducks and peacocks in the small zoo. Another peak experience will be the culinary adventure of sampling Greek cuisine. Huge feta cheese salads with olives, tomatoes, lettuce, and locally produced olive oil are outstanding. The main course of a meal in a taverna specializing in spit roasting is usually a plate of some type of seafood or meat such as chicken, pork, lamb or beef. The meat is grilled on a spit outdoors. Side dishes of fruit and vegetables are also served. Local wines provide a complement to the meal.\r\n\r\nWhile in Athens, consider a side excursion to one or more of the \"isles of Greece.\" It is easy to arrange a day trip by boat from Piraeus to one or more of the islands of the Saronic Gulf: Aegina Egina, Poros, and Hydra Idra.

The first Russian reference to Moscow dates from 1147 when Yuri Dolgoruki called upon the prince of the Novgorod Republic to “come to me, brother, to Moscow.”\r\n\r\nMoscow is a major economic centre and is home to the largest number of billionaires in the world; in 2008 Moscow was named the world\'s most expensive city for foreign employees for the third year in a row.\r\nIt is home to many scientific and educational institutions, as well as numerous sport facilities. It possesses a complex transport system, that includes 3 international airports, 9 railroad terminals, and one of the world’s busiest metro systems which is famous for its architecture and artwork.\r\n','For hundreds of years Moscow has been the center of the Russian national culture. The city possesses the most valuable historical and architectural monuments of world importance: the Kremlin, Novo-Devichiy Convent, Church of Pokrov in Fili, Moscow State University, Triumphal Arch, Memorial complex of Victory on the Poklonnaya Gora. The Temple of Christ, the Savior, on Kropotkinskaya embankment (it became Moscow’s Cathedral), the Kremlin’s Voskresenskiye Gates together with the Iverskaya Chapel and Temple of Icon of Kazan Mother of God on Red square were built anew. \r\n\r\nA great number of historic monuments are being reconstructed and restored. The process to preserve the historic heritage goes on and the Moscow government bodies act as its sponsors and active participants.

According to legend, the archangel Michael appeared to St. Aubert, bishop of Avranches, in 708 and instructed him to build a church on the rocky islet. Aubert repeatedly ignored the angel’s instruction, until Michael burned a hole in the bishop’s skull with his finger.<br />\r\nThe mount gained strategic significance in 933 when William “Long Sword”, William I, Duke of Normandy, annexed the Cotentin Peninsula, definitively placing the mount in Normandy. It is depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry, which commemorates the 1066 Norman conquest of England. Ducal patronage financed the spectacular Norman architecture of the abbey in subsequent centuries.<br />\r\nIn 1067, the monastery of Mont-Saint-Michel gave its support to duke William of Normandy in his claim to the throne of England. It was rewarded with properties and grounds on the English side of the Channel, including a small island located at the west of Cornwall, which, modelled after the Mount, became a Norman priory named St Michael’s Mount of Penzance.<br />\r\nDuring the Hundred Years’ War the English made repeated assaults on the island but were unable to seize it, partly because of the abbey’s improved fortifications.

However, its popularity and prestige as a centre of pilgrimage waned with the Reformation, and by the time of the French Revolution there were scarcely any monks in residence. The abbey was closed and converted into a prison, initially to hold clerical opponents of the republican régime. High-profile political prisoners followed, but by 1836 influential figures, including Victor Hugo, had launched a campaign to restore what was seen as a national architectural treasure. The prison was finally closed in 1863, and the mount was declared a historic monument in 1874.

Popularly nicknamed “St. Michael in peril of the sea” by medieval pilgrims making their way across the flats, the mount can still pose dangers for visitors who avoid the causeway and attempt the hazardous walk across the sands from the neighbouring coast. The danger of drowning from coastal tides after getting caught in quicksand continues to claim lives.<br />\r\nPolderisation and occasional flooding created salt marsh meadows that were found to be ideally suited to grazing sheep.

I catch this island by bus. At this island I do fishing, diving, and kayaking. In marathon kayaking was most interesting and it was available for both beginner and experienced.

At this island a lot of attractions were there. At this island first of all I saw the Crocker wall which was very large and the guide was telling that it is 450 foot long in 50 feet of water. There were different kinds of reefs but I went to pickles reef which provides the wonderful opportunity to encounter the reef’s minutia, from flamingo tongue cowries to banded coral shrimp, all amid a dynamic coral reef in only 20 to 25 feet of water. I also saw the eagle which was a very large ship and this ship was looking as a dive attraction. This ship was sunk in 110 feet of water and reset on her starboard side. At this island, I take my lunch at bob’s bunz which was a charming bayside restaurant and most popular for tourists and local public also. I also enjoy the nightlife of this city and went to ocean view inn and sports bar for celebrating this beautiful night.
